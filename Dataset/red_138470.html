I Psychologically Harm Myself, because I Hate Myself
<p/>
<P>I feel like I have tried everything else, so maybe thing will help. I can hid behind my screen yet at the same time feel like I am actually telling someone about my problem.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I don't know why I hate myself.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Actually thats a lie, I know why. What I don't understand is why I can't convience myself that its all in my head. I live an extremly previliged life. I have an amazing family, great friends and honestly my life is pretty easy. I feel like I should be happy all the time, but the truth is that I am hardly ever happy. Yet no one seems to see that. I feel like I want to yell out for help because I am drowning yet I don't have a voice, and even if I did no one would be able to hear me anyways.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I hate myself so mcuh. The only reason I continue to push through is because I love my family and friends and I know that their lives would not be easier without me, well at least not at first. My little sister is my best friend and I know she looks up to me and loves me and it would mess her up to know that I am messed up. She has a hard enough time with me away at college, I don't know what she would do if I was gone forever. My parents are the same way. They love me so much, and I know it. Thats why I can't talk to them though, they would be so destroyed to figure out that I am so f*$%ed up, they would feel like they failed me as my parents. Which of course isn't true. Its not their fault, they have only ever been supportive and loving.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So on to why I hate myself.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>First, I am not a good person. I try, I really do. I volunteer, I love to help people and heal people. But I can do better, I still hurt people. Maybe its not intentional, but I do. I can do so much more for the world and yet I don't do it. How can I love myself knowing that I am not doing all the good I could be? Mother Theresa helped millions of people, and yet I am over here being selfish, watching netflix and feeling sorry for myself.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Second, I am not smart. I don't get good grades. I can't even say that I try to get all As because I don't. I just feel like there is more to life then simply getting good grades. Thats when reality sets back in and I realize I need to do well in school to do well in life, at least according to socities ideals.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Third, I have a hard time beliving that anyone likes me. Really, I question how much my friends want to be friends with me all the time. Why? Because I wouldn't want to be friends with myself. So why should they want to waste their time on me. I am in a Sorority and yet I feel all the girls are able to connect so much deeper then myself. I just have a really hard time making a deep emotional connection.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fourth, I have now had sex with 9 guys. I am a slut. I am 20 years old. The last one i stopped us as soon as we started because I knew that wasn't what I wanted. I hate myself so much for having sex. People tell you then to just stop but I spent my life growing up being told that I was attractive and having society drop my self worth to how much guys want me. Don't get me wrong, I wear the typical girl next door outfit. You know jeans and natural make up are pretty much my go to. Yet I never have a problem getting guys, in fact I have a harder time getting them to stay away. The things is that no guy wants to date me. I am the slam piece that they get to brag to their friends about. When I am really depressed I find a guy to adore me and to tell me that I am attractive and then they usual make a move, where that all leads to depends. Usually I don't stop it because I trust the guy and they are one of my friends, but then afterwards I hate myself for it so much that it causes me to feel ill.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sorry for the long rant, I will probably have more to say later. I just had to get these thigs out because I don't know how much longer I can keep it all in.</P>
